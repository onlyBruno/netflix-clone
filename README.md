### My first try on duplicating the Netflix page
---
#### v1
Without the actual page, I tried to go as close as I could go during an afternoon tea party.

I've noticed that the menu is just a gradient background into the hero image.

Also, all images are in the carousel menu are using landscape mode.

## To do list: 
- [x] First Version released.
- [x] Add gradient color to the header.
- [ ] Make sure the hero image behave as indeed.
- [ ] Add images as landscape intead of portrait.
- [ ] Play ytb video once the PLAY button is pressed.
- [ ] Fine tunning into elements positioning, font size, buttons behavior.
